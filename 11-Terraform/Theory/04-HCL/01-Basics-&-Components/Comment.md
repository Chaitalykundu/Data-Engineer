# Comment

The Terraform language supports **three** different syntaxes for comments:

1. `#` begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.
2. `//` also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to #.
3. `/*` and `*/` are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span over multiple lines.

The `#` single-line comment style is the default comment style and should be used in most cases. Automatic configuration formatting tools may automatically transform `//` comments into `#` comments, since the double-slash style is not idiomatic.
