&nbsp;

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks

- Set up a free dbt Cloud account
- Connect to a sample warehouse (like Snowflake or BigQuery)
- Create your first dbt project
- Build a simple model using select \* from my_table

&nbsp;

## ✅ Milestone Checkpoint

- You can explain what dbt is, when to use it, and how to create a model.
- You have a running dbt project with at least one model and a source.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 🟡 Phase 2: Intermediate – Templating, Testing, and Documentation (Week 2-3)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Modular SQL with Jinja macros
- Sources, Seeds, Snapshots, and Ref
- Data Testing (Unique, Not Null, Relationships)
- Auto-Documentation & dbt docs
- Use of dbt run, dbt test, dbt build, dbt compile

&nbsp;

## 📚 Free Resources

- dbt Docs: Jinja & Macros
- dbt Learn Intermediate
- GitHub: dbt sample project — jaffle_shop

&nbsp;

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks

- Add 2–3 sources with freshness checks
- Create models using ref() and macros
- Write at least 5 tests on your models
- Generate and serve dbt docs

&nbsp;

## ✅ Milestone Checkpoint

- ✅ You’ve built a full pipeline with source → model → test → doc.
- ✅ You’re using Jinja to make your SQL modular and DRY.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 🟠 Phase 3: Advanced – Materializations, CI/CD, and Version Control (Week 4-5)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Materializations: ephemeral, table, incremental
- Advanced testing (schema + data)
- Version control and dbt with GitHub/GitLab
- dbt run-operation & macros
- dbt Packages (like dbt-utils)
- Deployment via dbt Cloud or CLI + CI

&nbsp;

## 📚 Free Resources

- dbt Materializations
- Git + dbt Guide
- dbt-utils package
- YouTube: CI/CD with dbt + GitHub Actions

&nbsp;

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks

- Use incremental materialization for large data loads
- Integrate GitHub repo for your dbt project
- Use dbt run-operation to call a macro
- Add dbt_utils package and use group_by macro

&nbsp;

## ✅ Milestone Checkpoint

- ✅ Your project uses version control and incremental builds.
- ✅ You have implemented a simple CI/CD pipeline.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
