  - `stg_customers.sql`: handle nulls, rename fields

&nbsp;

- Intermediate Models:
  - int_customer_orders.sql: join orders with customers

&nbsp;

- Final/Reporting Models (fct* or dim*):
  - fct_orders.sql: aggregate daily order metrics
  - dim_customers.sql: customer profiles with lifetime value

&nbsp;

- Tests:
  - customer_id is not null and unique
  - order_status in accepted values: ['completed', 'cancelled']
