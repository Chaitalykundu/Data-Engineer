# Answers

## Introduction

### Theory

#### 1. What is DBT

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### 2. What is Data Ingestion

Data Ingestion is the first step in a modern data pipeline. It refers to the process of collecting and importing data from various sources into a storage or processing systemâ€”typically a data warehouse, data lake, or data lakehouse.

## DBT Models

### 2. What happen when you run dbt model

When you run `dbt run`, dbt:

- Compiles the SQL (with Jinja templating),
- dbt determines the object type from materialization
- Runs it on data warehouse, and
- Creates a **view** or **table** in the target schema based on your configuration.

### 3. Which Objects Can dbt Models Create

Types of Objects dbt Models Can Create (Based on Materialization)

| Materialization | What It Creates           | Notes                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| view (default)  | A SQL view                | Light-weight; always reflects latest data                 |
| table           | A physical table          | Heavier; faster for downstream queries                    |
| incremental     | A partially-updated table | Only adds new/updated data; efficient for large tables    |
| ephemeral       | No object                 | Used as CTE in downstream models; great for modular logic |
|                 |                           |                                                           |
