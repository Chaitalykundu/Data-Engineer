# Pipeline

Pipeline refers to a series of stages or steps through which data or processes flow, often in a sequential and automated manner.

# Pipelines in various domains

## In Software Development / DevOps

A **CI/CD pipeline** automates the steps required to _test, build, and deploy code_.

&nbsp;

### Example stages

- **Code Commit** – Developer pushes code to a repository (like GitHub).
- **Build** – The code is compiled or built.
- **Test** – Automated tests are run to check code quality.
- **Deploy** – Code is deployed to staging or production environments.

## In Data Engineering

A data pipeline is a set of processes that move data from one system to another, usually transforming it along the way.

&nbsp;

### Example

- Extract data from a database.
- Transform it (cleaning, aggregating, etc.).
- Load it into a data warehouse (ETL process).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## In Machine Learning

An ML pipeline automates the workflow of building and deploying machine learning models.

&nbsp;

### Steps include

- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## In Computer Architecture

A **CPU pipeline** refers to the technique of splitting instruction execution into discrete steps (fetch, decode, execute, etc.) to improve performance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
