# Introduction

Many enterprises are shifting from ETL to modern ELT architecture.

&nbsp;

## ETL

ETL is the traditional technique of extracting raw data from the source systems first, then Business logic or transformations are applied to it for the users as required and finally processed data is loaded or stored in data warehouse for consumption.

ETL is more traditional, useful in on-premise or legacy environments.
&nbsp;

| Step          | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extract**   | Pull data from source systems (DBs, APIs, files, etc.)   |
| **Transform** | Clean, join, and enrich data **before loading**          |
| **Load**      | Load the transformed data into the target data warehouse |

&nbsp;

Here , Transformation happens outside the data warehouse, typically using ETL tools or scripts.

&nbsp;

### Used When:

- The warehouse is not powerful enough to handle heavy transformations.
- You want full control of data before storage.

&nbsp;

### üõ†Ô∏è Common ETL Tools:

Informatica, Talend, Apache Nifi, SSIS

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## ELT

ELT is the approach where data is initially extracted raw data from the source and loaded into the data warehouse typically in its raw form.
Subsequently data transformations are carried out within the data warehouse itself.

ELT is the modern standard in cloud data platforms, enabling better performance, scalability, and maintainability.

&nbsp;

| Step          | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Extract**   | Pull data from source systems                                            |
| **Load**      | Load raw data into the data warehouse                                    |
| **Transform** | Use SQL or tools like **dbt** to transform data **inside** the warehouse |

&nbsp;

Transformation happens inside the warehouse, leveraging its compute power.

Modern approach, optimized for cloud-based platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks.

&nbsp;

### üõ†Ô∏è Common ELT Tools:

Fivetran (E+L), dbt (T), Airbyte, Stitch

# Difference between ELT and ETL

| ELT                                                                                                        | ETL                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ELT tools do not require additional hardware                                                               | ETL tools require specific hardware with their own engines to perform transformations |
| Mostly Hadoop or NoSQL database to store data. Rarely RDBMS is used                                        | RDBMS is used exclusively to store data                                               |
| As all components are in one system, loading is done only once                                             | As ETL uses staging area, extra time is required to load the data                     |
| Time to transform data is independent of the size of data The system has to wait for large sizes of data.  | As the size of data increases, transformation time also increases                     |
| It is cost effective and available to all business using SaaS solution                                     | Not cost effective for small and medium business                                      |
| The data transformed is used by data scientists and advanced analysts                                      | The data transformed is used by users reading report and SQL coders                   |
| Creates ad hoc views.Low cost for building and maintaining                                                 | Views are created based on multiple scripts.Deleting view means deleting data         |
| Best for unstructured and non-relational data. Ideal for data lakes. Suited for very large amounts of data | Best for relational and structured data. Better for small to medium amounts of data   |

# ETL vs ELT

| Feature                 | ETL (Extract ‚Üí Transform ‚Üí Load)          | ELT (Extract ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Transform)        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Where transform happens | Outside the warehouse (e.g., Spark, SSIS) | Inside the warehouse (e.g., dbt)        |
| Order                   | Data is transformed before loading        | Data is loaded first, transformed later |
| Tools                   | Informatica, Talend, SSIS, Spark          | Fivetran, Airbyte + dbt                 |
| Performance             | Slower for large data                     | Faster, leverages warehouse compute     |
| Scalability             | Often limited                             | Cloud-native scalability                |

# Why Use ETL? (Extract ‚Üí Transform ‚Üí Load)

## ‚úÖ Use ETL when:

| Scenario                                             | Why ETL is Better                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| üè¢ **On-premise systems**                            | You don‚Äôt use cloud data warehouses yet           |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Complex transformations needed** before storing | Logic-heavy workflows or sensitive business rules |
| üíæ **You want to reduce storage costs**              | Transforming first avoids storing raw data        |
| üîê **Data security or compliance** is key            | Avoids loading sensitive raw data into cloud      |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## üí° Example Use Cases:

- Healthcare data with privacy rules (e.g., HIPAA)

- Legacy enterprise systems like SAP, Oracle, etc.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Why Use ELT? (Extract ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Transform)

## ‚úÖ Use ELT when:

| Scenario                                               | Why ELT is Better                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **You're using modern cloud data warehouses**       | Like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks  |
| ‚ö° **You need faster performance & scalability**       | Leverage the warehouse's compute power          |
| üß™ **You want flexibility to test/analyze raw data**   | Keep raw + cleaned data for lineage & debugging |
| ü§ù **You're using modular, code-based tools like dbt** | Software engineering practices for analytics    |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## büí° Example Use Cases:

- Real-time marketing data pipelines (using Fivetran + dbt)

- Centralizing SaaS data (Salesforce, HubSpot) for BI tools

# Final Decision Logic : Choosing ETL or ELT

| Question                                              | Choose |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Is your data warehouse powerful (Snowflake/BigQuery)? | ‚úÖ ELT |
| Do you need raw data available for audits/testing?    | ‚úÖ ELT |
| Are you transforming complex data before loading?     | ‚úÖ ETL |
| Is storage expensive and compute limited?             | ‚úÖ ETL |
| Want a modern, scalable, agile approach?              | ‚úÖ ELT |
