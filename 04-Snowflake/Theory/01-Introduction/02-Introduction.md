# Snowflake

Snowflake is a **cloud data platform** for data storage and analytics purpose, that offers data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, and more.

&nbsp;

It runs on Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and the google cloud platform.

Snowflake doesn't have their own infrastructure.

It's designed to be more flexible, faster, and easier to use than traditional data warehouses.

&nbsp;

Snowflake's architecture is **built for the cloud** and **uses a new SQL database engine** instead of existing database or "big data" software platforms such as Hadoop. It's built on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure.

To the user, Snowflake provides all of the functionality of an enterprise analytic database, along with many additional special features and unique capabilities.

The analytic solutions provided by Snowflake are faster, easy to use and more flexible than traditional databases and their analytics features. Snowflake stores and provide data near time not in actual real time.

Snowflake is **_Software as a Service (SaaS) == Data platform as a Cloud Service == Data Warehouse as a Cloud Service (DWaaS)_**

&nbsp;

# About Snowflake

- **_Build for the cloud_**
  - Build from scratch (cloud-native), optimize for cloud(AWS, GCP, Azure), storage and compute is decoupled

  - All kinds of use cases are supported ( Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Data Engineering, Streaming, Data Application, Data Science, Data Exchange)

  - Share data to internal as well as external customers securely.

- **_Software as a Service (SaaS)_**
  - No software, infrastructure, or upgrades to manage.

  - All update, maintenance and releases are done by snowflake and it is available for all the customers automatically
  - Available in all 3 major cloud providers

- **_Pay only for used compute and storage_**
  - Storage and Compute charged independently and only for usage
  - If you store TB's of data and no processing, you only need to pay for storage, not for computing.

- **_Scalable_**
  - Virtual warehouse enables computing scaling independently from storage
  - The scalability is virtually unlimited and Storage and Compute both can scale as needed and independent from each other

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Snowflake's features include

- <u>**Decoupled architecture**</u>: Snowflake's architecture has three decoupled layers: storage, compute, and cloud services.

- <u>**Elastic scalability**</u>: Snowflake can scale on demand to meet different workloads.

- <u>**Snowflake Horizon**</u>: A built-in governance solution to manage security, compliance, privacy, interoperability, and access to data and apps.

- <u>**Data engineering**</u>: Build reliable, continuous data pipelines at scale.

- <u>**Query processing layer**</u>: A layer that provides the means for executing various SQL statements. It consists of multiple independent compute clusters with nodes processing queries in parallel. Snowflake calls these clusters virtual warehouses.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Cloud Data Platform

A cloud data platform is a **data center** in the cloud that provides virtualized access to data from various sources and locations.

It can help organizations move their data from on-premises storage to multi-cloud environments.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# The value of Cloud Data Platform

- Unlimited Performance and scale
- One platform, one copy of data, and many workloads
- Secure governed access to all data
- Near-zero maintenance as a service

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# One platform, One copy of data, Many workload

One platform - Snowflake
One copy of data - Data
Many workload - Data Warehouse, Data lake, Data Engineering, Data Application, Data Science, Data Exchange

- <u>**_Data Warehouse_**</u> : Modernize data warehousing to deliver faster analytics at scale
- <u>**_Data lake_**</u> : Simplify and accelerate your data lake with one platform for all the data
- <u>**_Data Engineering_**</u> : Rethink transformation with rebust and integrated data pipelines

- <u>**_Data Application_**</u> : Develop apps with faster and scalable analytics that delight customers

- <u>**_Data Science_**</u> : Simplify and accelerate machine learning and artificial intelligence

- <u>**_Data Exchange_**</u> : Empower your eco-system with secure, governed access to all data

# Snowflake’s Data Cloud platform

Snowflake’s Data Cloud is powered by an advanced data platform provided as **a self-managed service**.

Snowflake enables data storage, processing, and analytic solutions that are faster, easier to use, and far more flexible than traditional offerings.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Data Platform as a Self-managed Service

Snowflake is a true self-managed service, meaning:

- There is **no hardware** (virtual or physical) to select, install, configure, or manage.

- There is virtually **no software** to install, configure, or manage.

- Ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and tuning are handled by Snowflake.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Snowflake runs completely on **cloud infrastructure**.

All components of Snowflake’s service (other than optional command line clients, drivers, and connectors), run in **public** cloud infrastructures.

Snowflake uses **virtual compute instances** for its compute needs and a storage service for persistent storage of data.

**_Snowflake cannot be run on private cloud infrastructures (on-premises or hosted)_**
