# Evolution of Cloud Data Platform

## 1st Evolution

- Traditional on-premise Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)
- They were able to answer the business questions very fast
- They were all sql database

&nbsp;

#### Challenges

- Not designed for all kinds of data ( structured and unstructured)
- Not designed for all users who may have demand for that data
- Inherently incapable to scale up / down as per business demand.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2nd Evolution

- 1st generation Cloud EDW
- They moved the same code into the public cloud
- They were able to answer the business questions very fast

&nbsp;

#### Challenges

- Not designed for all kinds of data ( structured and unstructured)
- Not designed for all users

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3rd Evolution

- Hadoop / Data lake
- Can load any kind of data
- A lot of users who have the demand for the data can access it to a certain extend

&nbsp;

#### Challenges

- Not fast and no native support to SQL
- Performance and scalability was challenging (operational & manageability)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 4th Evolution

- Cloud Data Platform
- All users, all data, fast answer, sql - all features are in single platform now.
- Natively ingest structured / semi-structured data
- Concurrent access to as many users within the organization
- Standard SQL DB, so easy to manage.
