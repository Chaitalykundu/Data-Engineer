# SELECT

1. From the `books` table only select the columns `title` and `publication_year`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# SELECT & ORDER BY

2. Given the `books` table, write a SQL query to:
   - Select all columns from the `books` table.
   - Order the results by the `price` in descending order.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# SELECT DISTINCT & LIMIT

3. Write a single SQL query to retrieve the first 5 unique genres in ascending alphabetical order.

   - Column: `genre` in the `books` table.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# COUNT()

4. Given the table `employees`, write a single SQL query to count the total number of employees in the company.

   - Table Name: `employees`
   - Relevant Columns: `id` (you can count rows using any column, but id is usually preferred for its uniqueness)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Where

5. Write a SQL query to find all products in the 'Electronics' category. Select only the name of the product and the price. You need to use only the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to achieve this. Sort the results by price in ascending order.

   - Table: `products`
   - Columns: `product_id`, `name`, `category`, `price`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# WHERE operators

6. Write a SQL query to find all products (only select name and price) that have a price of more than 200. You need to use only the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to achieve this. Sort the results by **price** in ascending order.

   - Table: `products`
   - Columns: `product_id`, `name`, `category`, `price`
