# Definition

The `WHERE` clause is used to **filter rows** before they are returned by the query.

It comes after `FROM` (and JOINs) but before `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `SELECT` output in SQLâ€™s logical execution order.

The `WHERE` clause is not only used in `SELECT` statement, but it is also used in `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statement, etc., which we will learn in subsequent chapters

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Examples

## 1. Simple comparison

```sql
SELECT first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns only employees with salary greater than 50,000.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2. Multiple conditions with **AND** / **OR**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' AND salary >= 40000;
```

&nbsp;

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance';
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. Range check with **BETWEEN**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Includes salaries between 30000 and 60000.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 4. Matching a set with IN

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Finance', 'IT');
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 5. Pattern matching with LIKE

```sql
-- Names starting with 'A'
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';

-- Names ending with 'n'
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n';

-- Names containing 'ai'
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%ai%';
```

ðŸ‘‰ % = any sequence of characters, \_ = exactly one character.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 6. Checking for NULL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use IS NULL (not = NULL, which wonâ€™t work).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 7. Negation

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department NOT IN ('HR', 'Finance');
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 8. With dates

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01';
```

# Key Points to Remember

- `WHERE` filters rows (before grouping).
- `HAVING` filters groups (after aggregation).
- You cannot use aggregate functions (like `SUM()`, `AVG()`) inside `WHERE`.
  - âœ… Use `HAVING` instead.
- `WHERE` executes before `SELECT`, so you usually canâ€™t use column aliases from `SELECT`.

# operators - used in the WHERE clause

The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

| Operator | Description                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| =        | Equal                                                                         |
| >        | Greater than                                                                  |
| <        | Less than                                                                     |
| >=       | Greater than or equal                                                         |
| <=       | Less than or equal                                                            |
| <>       | Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as `!=` |
| BETWEEN  | Between a certain range                                                       |
| LIKE     | Search for a pattern                                                          |
| IN       | To specify multiple possible values for a column                              |
