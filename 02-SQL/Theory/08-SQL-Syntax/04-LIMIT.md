# Definition

The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` query.

It will be always used at the very end of the query.

&nbsp;

It‚Äôs commonly used when:

- You only want to preview a few rows (like top 5 results)
- You‚Äôre paginating query results
- You want faster testing on large tables

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Examples

## 1. Get first 5 rows

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```

üëâ Returns only the first 5 rows of the employees table.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2. Limit with ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

üëâ Returns the top 3 highest-paid employees.

&nbsp;

### Note

üí° Always use `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` if you want consistent results ‚Äî
otherwise, databases may return any 3 random rows.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. LIMIT with OFFSET (for pagination)

Some databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) allow:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

üëâ Skips the first 10 rows and then shows the next 5 rows (i.e., rows 11‚Äì15).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 4. Alternative syntax (MySQL style)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 10, 5;
```

üëâ Equivalent to LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 5. LIMIT with DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees
LIMIT 3;
```

üëâ Returns 3 unique department names.
