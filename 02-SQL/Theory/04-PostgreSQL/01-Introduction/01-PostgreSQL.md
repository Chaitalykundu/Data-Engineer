# What is PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is free open-source Object-Relational Database Management System.

PostgreSQL is a back-end database for dynamic websites and web applications.

It is modern

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Features of PostgreSQL

- **_Robustness_** : It is highly reliable, stable, and secure, making it a preferred choice for mission-critical applications

- Reliability

- Advanced features

- Provides a powerful and scalable platform for managing large number of structured data

- **_Relational and Object-Oriented_** : Combines traditional SQL relational database capabilities with object-oriented features.
- PostgreSQL supports a wide range data types, indexing option and query optimization techniques

- **_ACID Compliance_** : It offers ACID compliance and supports transactions which insures data integrity and reliability.

- **_JSON & NoSQL Support_** : PostgreSQL supports both relational (SQL) and non-relational (JSON) queries.

- **_MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)_** : Prevents read locks and improves database performance in high-concurrency environments

- **_Security & Authentication_** â€“ Supports SSL, Role-based Access Control (RBAC), and Encryption.

### Final Verdict

- Choose PostgreSQL if you need a powerful,
  extensible, open-source database with complex query
  support and big data capabilities.

- Choose SQL Server if you are in a Microsoft
  ecosystem and need enterprise-level support with
  Windows-based applications.

- Choose MySQL if you need a lightweight, high-speed, and easy-to-use database for web applications and startups.
