# Key Considerations

- MySQL and PostgreSQL are ideal for most general-purpose apps.
- SQLite is excellent for offline/local applications.
- Oracle and SQL Server dominate in the enterprise sector.
- Cloud-native options like Snowflake, RDS, and BigQuery (semi-SQL) are ideal for scalable and serverless environments.
