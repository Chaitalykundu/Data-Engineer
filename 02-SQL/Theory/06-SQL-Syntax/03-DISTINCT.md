# Definition

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set of a `SELECT` query.
It ensures that each row returned is unique.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Syntax

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Examples

## 1. Single column

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns each department name only once, even if many employees are in the same department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2. Multiple columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department, job_title
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns unique (**department**, **job_title**) combinations.
If two rows have the same department and job title, duplicates are removed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. Using DISTINCT with expressions

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(department)
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns unique department names (case-insensitive).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 4. Counting distinct values

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department)
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns how many unique departments exist.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 5. DISTINCT + ORDER BY

You can combine both:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns unique departments sorted alphabetically.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 6. DISTINCT with NULLs

`DISTINCT` treats **NULL** as a value â€” so all NULLs are considered the same.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT manager_id
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ If multiple employees have `NULL` **manager_id**, only one **NULL** will appear.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Key Points

- âœ… Removes duplicates from the selected columns
- âœ… Applies to the entire row (all columns in the `SELECT` list)
- âœ… Can be used with functions like `COUNT()` â†’ `COUNT(DISTINCT col)`
- âœ… `DISTINCT` is processed after **WHERE but before ORDER BY**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Performance Tip

Using `DISTINCT` can be expensive on large datasets â€”

- since the database must sort or hash the results to find duplicates.
- When possible, filter earlier or use `GROUP BY` if you need aggregations too.
