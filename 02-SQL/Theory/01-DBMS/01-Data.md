# Data : (raw entity)

- Data is the collection of a distinct small unit of info (e.g. Raw facts, figures, statics) that can be processed to generate meaningful information.

- Ex : text, image, audio, video, map etc

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Types of Database

There are mainly **two** types of data.

1. Structured Data
2. Unstructured Data

# Difference Between Structured and Unstructured Data

| Feature     | Structured Data                                                        | Unstructured Data                                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition  | Organized data stored in a fixed format (e.g., tables, rows, columns). | Data without a predefined format or structure.          |
| Storage     | Stored in relational databases (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL.         | Stored in NoSQL databases, data lakes, or file systems. |
| Format      | Tabular (e.g., SQL tables, spreadsheets).                              | Text, images, videos, emails, social media posts.       |
| Processing  | Easily searchable using SQL queries.                                   | Requires AI, NLP, or data mining for analysis.          |
| Flexibility | Rigid structure, difficult to modify schema.                           | Highly flexible and scalable.                           |
| Examples    | Customer records, sales data, employee details.                        | Social media posts, medical images, sensor data         |
|             |                                                                        |                                                         |

&nbsp;

# Database

- Collection of similar or related data in a format that can be easily accessed.

- It is used to organize data in the form of a **table, schema, view, reports** etc.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# DBMS

- DBMS is a software application used to create, manipulate or delete database.

- It provides an organized way to interact with databases and ensures data consistency, security, and integrity.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# DBM

- DBM refers to managing database by performing some operations like inserting, deleting, sorting etc.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
