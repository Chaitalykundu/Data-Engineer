# Select Statement

`SELECT` is the most important SQL statement.

Itâ€™s used to retrieve data from a database table.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Syntax

## Retrieve all data

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

&nbsp;

## Select specific columns

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Example

## Select all columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns all rows and columns from the employees table.

&nbsp;

## Select specific columns

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Only shows first name, last name, and salary.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Remove duplicates with DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Returns only unique department names.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Use expressions in SELECT

You can calculate values inside the query.

```sql
SELECT first_name, salary, salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Creates a new column annual_salary as salary Ã— 12.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Combine text with CONCAT

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Combines first name and last name into full_name.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
