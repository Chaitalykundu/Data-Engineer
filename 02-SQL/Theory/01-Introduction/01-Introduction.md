# Database

Database is a **collection of similar and organized data** in a format that can be easily accessed.

A software application used to manage our DataBase is called Database Management System (DBMS).

&nbsp;

## Types of Database

- Relational database

  - Also known as RDBMS
  - Data stored in tables
  - Popular RDBMS are : MySQL, SQLServer, Oracle, PostgreSQL
  - We use SQL to work with relational DBMS

- Non-Relational database
  - Also known as No-SQL
  - Data not stored in table
  - Ex : MongoDB

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# What is SQL?

- SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**

- It is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

- SQL is used to interact with relational databases

&nbsp;

## Use of SQL

SQL is used to perform CRUD operation

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

&nbsp;

It is used for:

- Querying data (`SELECT`)
- Modifying data (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- Defining data structure (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`)
- Access control (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## What Can SQL do?

SQL can

- **execute queries** against a database
- **retrieve data** from a database
- **insert records** in a database
- **update records** in a database
- **delete records** from a database
- **create new databases**
- **create new tables** in a database
- **create stored procedures** in a database
- **create views** in a database
- **set permissions** on tables, procedures, and views

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Features of SQL

1. Manage data held in a relational database
2. Easy to learn
3. Very powerful

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Using SQL in Your Web Site

To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

- an RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL, pgadmin)

- to use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
- to use SQL to get the data you want
- to use HTML / CSS to style the page

&nbsp;

# Job role in data field where SQL is Used

- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- Data Analyst
- SQL Developer
- Business Analyst
- Quality Analyst

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## How data is stored

In terms of

- tables
- rows
- columns

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Types of SQL Statements

| Category | Statements                            | Purpose                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **DDL**  | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE` | Define and modify database structure |
| **DML**  | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`          | Manipulate data in tables            |
| **DQL**  | `SELECT`                              | Retrieve data from a database        |
| **DCL**  | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                     | Control access to data               |
