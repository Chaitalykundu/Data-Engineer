# What is a Variable?

A variable is a name that stores data or value in memory.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Declaring a Variable

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.8
is_student = True
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Rules for Naming Variables

1. Must start with a letter (`A-Z` or `a-z`) or underscore (`_`)
2. Can include letters, numbers, and underscores
3. Cannot start with a digit
4. Case-sensitive (`Name ≠ name`)
5. Avoid Pytho05-Datatypes.md
6. n keywords (like `if`, `for`, `class` etc.)

&nbsp;

# Examples

```py
x = 10
_y = "Valid"
name1 = "John"
# 1name = "Invalid" ❌
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Dynamic Typing

You don’t need to declare the type — Python figures it out.

```python
value = 42       # integer
value = "hello"  # now a string
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Multiple Assignments

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
x = y = z = 0
```
