# `else` Statement

The `else` block runs when the `if` condition is **False**.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Syntax

```py
if condition:
    # code if condition is True
else:
    # code if condition is False
```

&nbsp;

The `else` must be used with an `if` statement and doesn't take any condition.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Example

```py
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are a Voter.")
else:
    print("You are not a Voter.")
```
