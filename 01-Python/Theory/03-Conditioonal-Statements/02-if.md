# `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only when a condition is `true`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Syntax

```py
if condition:
    # block of code to execute if condition is True
```

&nbsp;

## Note

The condition must evaluate to `True` or `False`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Example

```py
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Indentation is important

The block under `if` must be indented properly (usually **4 spaces** or **a tab**).
