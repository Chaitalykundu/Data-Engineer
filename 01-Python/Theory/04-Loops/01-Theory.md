# Loop

A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Instead of writing the same code again and again, you use a loop to run it automatically as many times as needed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Why use loops?

- To repeat tasks easily
- To process lists, strings, numbers
- To avoid writing duplicate code

# Types of Loops

| Loop Type    | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `for` loop   | Iterates over a sequence (like list, string, range) |
| `while` loop | Runs as long as a condition is `True`               |

&nbsp;

### Note

There is no `do-while` loop in python.

| Keyword    | Use                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `break`    | Exit the loop immediately              |
