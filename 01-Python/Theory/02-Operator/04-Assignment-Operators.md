# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables and also to update them using arithmetic operations.

&nbsp;

Assignment operators are `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`

| Operator | Name                    | Description                                  | Example   | Equivalent To |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `=`      | Assignment              | Assigns value on right to variable on left   | `x = 10`  | â€”             |
| `+=`     | Add and assign          | Adds right to left and stores result in left | `x += 5`  | `x = x + 5`   |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign     | Subtracts right from left and assigns        | `x -= 2`  | `x = x - 2`   |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign     | Multiplies and assigns                       | `x *= 3`  | `x = x * 3`   |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign       | Divides and assigns                          | `x /= 2`  | `x = x / 2`   |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign | Floor divides and assigns                    | `x //= 2` | `x = x // 2`  |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign      | Takes remainder and assigns                  | `x %= 3`  | `x = x % 3`   |
| `**=`    | Power and assign        | Raises to power and assigns                  | `x **= 2` | `x = x ** 2`  |
